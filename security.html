            This Security Policy applies to all MuseumHub digital platforms (including our website, ticket booking system,
            AI chatbot, language translation system, virtual tours, and generated PDF tickets) as well as security practices
            followed within the physical museum location. It covers data protection, access control, infrastructure security,

        <p data-translate="security_stack_text1">
            MuseumHub is built using a modern web technology stack designed with security and reliability in mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li data-translate="security_stack_point1">
                <strong>Backend:</strong> Flask (Python) as the main backend framework for routing, authentication,
                and business logic.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_stack_point2">
                <strong>Database Layer:</strong> Flask-SQLAlchemy with SQLite for structured, ORM-based database access,
                reducing the risk of SQL injection through parameterized queries.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_stack_point3">
                <strong>Templating:</strong> Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML views with automatic escaping of dynamic data to reduce XSS risks.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_stack_point4">
                <strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface, chatbot interactions, and smooth UX.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_stack_point5">
                <strong>Localization:</strong> Flask-Babel for multilingual support, ensuring translated content is managed safely on the server side.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_stack_point6">
                <strong>CORS Control:</strong> Flask-CORS is used to control cross-origin requests in a safe and configurable way.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_stack_point7">
                <strong>Email System:</strong> Flask-Mail for sending verification, notifications, and ticket emails securely.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_stack_point8">
                <strong>PDF Tickets &amp; Documents:</strong> ReportLab (SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Table, etc.) for generating ticket PDFs
                and documents server-side, without exposing internal templates to the client.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_stack_point9">
                <strong>Payments:</strong> Razorpay integration for secure online payments using industry-standard payment security.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_stack_point10">
                <strong>Hashing &amp; Utilities:</strong> Python’s <code>hashlib</code> for cryptographic hashing, and safe usage of threading,
                JSON handling, and file operations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p data-translate="security_stack_text2">
            We follow best practices in Flask application development, including separation of concerns, configuration via environment variables,
            and minimal exposure of sensitive internal details.

            <p style="margin-top: 0.4rem;" data-translate="security_hashing_text">
                MuseumHub does <strong>not</strong> store plain-text passwords. All user passwords are protected using cryptographic hashing
                (via Python’s <code>hashlib</code> and secure hashing algorithms). This means that even if someone accessed the database,
                they would not see the original passwords in readable form.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p data-translate="security_auth_text1">
            When a user registers or logs in, their password is processed using a secure hashing function before storing or checking it against
            the database. We do not log raw passwords anywhere in the system.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li data-translate="security_auth_point1">Passwords are never stored or transmitted in plain text.</li>

    <section class="security-section">
        <h2 data-translate="security_data_title">4. Data Protection &amp; Secure Transmission</h2>
        <p data-translate="security_data_text1">
            Personal data such as names, contact details, ticket information, and booking history are treated as sensitive
            and are protected against unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li data-translate="security_data_point1">
                MuseumHub is intended to be deployed using <strong>HTTPS</strong> (TLS/SSL) so that all data transmitted between the user’s browser
                and the server is encrypted in transit.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_data_point2">
                Form inputs and API requests are validated and sanitized to reduce the risk of injection attacks and malformed data.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_data_point3">
                Access to sensitive data in the SQLite database is restricted at the application level to authorized operations only.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_data_point4">
                Generated PDFs (tickets, receipts) only contain necessary information and are created on the server using ReportLab,
                reducing the exposure of internal structures or logic.

        <p data-translate="security_cors_text1">
            MuseumHub uses JavaScript for interactive features including the chatbot, language switching, and dynamic updates.
            Flask-CORS is used in a controlled manner to manage which origins are allowed to access backend APIs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li data-translate="security_cors_point1">
                Only approved origins are allowed to make cross-origin requests (as configured in CORS settings).

            <li data-translate="security_cors_point2">
                Data displayed in HTML templates is automatically escaped by Jinja2 to help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_cors_point3">
                JSON responses are structured and sanitized before being sent to the frontend.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_cors_point4">
                Client-side JavaScript (including chatbot UI and translation scripts) does not store raw passwords or payment information.

        <p data-translate="security_email_text1">
            MuseumHub uses Flask-Mail to send emails such as booking confirmations, ticket PDFs, and important notifications.

        <ul>
            <li data-translate="security_email_point1">
                Emails are sent through configured SMTP servers that can support TLS encryption for secure email transmission.

                We avoid including sensitive data (such as full payment credentials or passwords) in email content.

            MuseumHub integrates <strong>Razorpay</strong> as a secure payment gateway for online ticket purchases and add-on services.
            Razorpay provides PCI-DSS compliant payment processing and handles sensitive card or UPI details on its own infrastructure.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li data-translate="security_payment_point1">
                Payment details (card numbers, CVV, UPI PIN, etc.) are not stored on the MuseumHub server or in the SQLite database.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_payment_point2">
                Payment requests are initiated via Razorpay’s secure APIs, and the backend verifies payment status using Razorpay credentials and signatures.
            </li>
            <li data-translate="security_payment_point3">
                Users are encouraged to verify Razorpay pages and never share OTPs or sensitive details with anyone claiming to be from MuseumHub.

            MuseumHub may use logging and basic monitoring to understand system health, performance, and suspicious activity.
            Threading and locking mechanisms are used carefully to ensure safe access to shared resources where applicable.
